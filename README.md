## Introduction
`serversideup/ansible` is a lightweight solution for running Ansible in a containerized environment. This project builds upon many things we learned from [willhallonline/docker-ansible](https://github.com/willhallonline/docker-ansible). It provides a secure and isolated environment for running Ansible tasks, with support for both Alpine and Debian-based distributions and gives you the flexibility to run Ansible as an unprivileged user without the headaches of proper file permissions.

## Features
- üêß **Debian and Alpine** - Choose your OS
- üêç **Built on official Python images** - Choose your Python version
- üîí **Unprivileged user** - Choose to run as root or an unprivileged user
- üìå **Pinned Ansible Version** - Set your Ansible version down to the patch version
- üîß **Customize your "run as" user** - Customize the username to run as
- üîë **Set your own PUID and PGID** - Have the PUID and PGID match your host user
- üì¶ **DockerHub and GitHub Container Registry** - Choose where you'd like to pull your image from
- ü§ñ **Multi-architecture** - Every image ships with x86_64 and arm64 architectures

## Usage
Getting started is easy. Here's a few tips on how to use this image.

### Choose between `ansible` and `ansible-core`

Our images are available on Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry ü•≥

**DockerHub:**
- [serversideup/ansible](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/ansible)
- [serversideup/ansible-core](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/ansible-core)

**GitHub Container Registry:**
- [ghcr.io/serversideup/ansible](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-ansible/pkgs/container/ansible)
- [ghcr.io/serversideup/ansible-core](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-ansible/pkgs/container/ansible-core)

Versions are made available with `ansible` and `ansible-core`. Everything is versioned appropriately according to the [Ansible release process](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html).

| Variation | Image Size | Description |
| --------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| `serversideup/ansible-core` |[![DockerHub serversideup/ansible-core:alpine](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/serversideup/ansible-core/alpine?label=alpine)](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/ansible-core/tags?name=alpine)<br>[![DockerHub serversideup/ansible-core](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/serversideup/ansible-core/latest?label=debian)](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/ansible-core) | Lightweight, core installation of Ansible. |
| `serversideup/ansible` | [![DockerHub serversideup/ansible:alpine](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/serversideup/ansible/alpine?label=alpine)](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/ansible/tags?name=alpine)<br>[![DockerHub serversideup/ansible](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/serversideup/ansible/latest?label=debian)](https://hub.docker.com/r/serversideup/ansible) | "Batteries included" installation of Ansible. |

## Image Tagging System

Our Docker images use a comprehensive tagging system for flexibility and specificity.

### Tag Components

| Component | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Ansible version | `2.17.3`, `2.17` |
| Base OS | `alpine3.20`, `bullseye` |
| Python version | `python3.11` |
| OS family | `alpine`, `debian` |

### Tag Examples

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `2.17.3-alpine3.20-python3.11` | Most specific |
| `2.17.3-alpine3.20` | Latest Python for specific Ansible and OS |
| `2.17.3` | Latest OS and Python for specific Ansible |
| `2.17-alpine3.20-python3.11` | Latest patch for Ansible minor version |
| `2.17-alpine-python3.11` | OS family-based |

## Run a playbook
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> In almost all cases you will need to mount a volume to the Ansible "working directory" (default: `/ansible`) and your SSH configurations (usually `~/.ssh`).

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/.ssh:/ssh" \
  -v "$(pwd):/ansible" \
  serversideup/ansible:latest ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

### Change the "run as" user, PUID and PGID

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/.ssh:/ssh" \
  -v "$(pwd):/ansible" \
  -e PUID=9999 -e PGID=9999 \
  -e RUN_AS_USER=bob \
  serversideup/ansible:latest ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

### Run a shell
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/.ssh:/ssh" \
  -v "$(pwd):/ansible" \
  serversideup/ansible:latest /bin/sh
```

### Working with SSH
> [!NOTE]  
> Working with SSH keys can be tricky, especially if we're setting a `RUN_AS_USER` dynamically. We created a few things to help reduce the headache of getting this configured.

#### The `/ssh` directory
By default, we have a `/ssh` directory that is symbolically linked from `~/.ssh`. The `/ssh` directory is used as our single source of truth for SSH keys and configurations.

If you set `RUN_AS_USER`, the entrypoint will create a home directory at `/home/${RUN_AS_USER}`, then create a symbolic link from `/home/${RUN_AS_USER}/.ssh` to `/ssh`. This gives you the power to set your `RUN_AS_USER` to anything you want without us needing to predict what user you want to run as.

#### Mounting the SSH auth socket
The SSH auth socket is a Unix socket used by the SSH agent to communicate with other processes, allowing for secure key management. To use it with Docker, you can mount it as follows:

**macOS:**
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/.ssh:/ssh:ro" \
  -v "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts:/ssh/known_hosts:rw" \
  -v "$(pwd):/ansible" \
  -v "/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock:/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock" \
  -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock" \
  serversideup/ansible:latest ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

Notice how we're matching the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` to the host's socket. This is necessary for the SSH agent to communicate with the container.

**Linux:**
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/.ssh:/ssh:ro" \
 -v "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts:/ssh/known_hosts:rw" \
  -v "$(pwd):/ansible" \
  -v "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK:$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" \
  -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" \
  serversideup/ansible:latest ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

### Environment Variables
You can customize the image easily with the following environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `PUID` | `1000` | Set the User ID that you'd like to run Ansible as |
| `PGID` | `1000` | Set the Group ID that you'd like to run Ansible as |
| `RUN_AS_USER` | `ansible` | The username you'd like to run Ansible as (this will be created for you and will default to an **unprivileged** user) |
| `DEBUG` | `false` | Enable debug output of container startup |
